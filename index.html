   <p> I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree in visual communication design with a certificate in User Experience/User interface design and a minor in psychology. I am passionate about improving people’s experiences with products, applications, and information. I am currently working for Eastern Washington University Student Affairs as a UX/Graphic designer and Social Media Coordinator.<br> <br>
On a personal note, I am married to my high school sweetheart. We met in middle school a got married a year after high school. We have a beautiful, spirited two-month-old daughter. Our two rescue cats are named Holly and Killua.<br> <br>
I am a proud member of Citizen Potawatomi Nation. I got the opportunity to participate in the Harvard Project Honoring Nations award-winning Potawatomi Leadership Program. The Potawatomi Leadership Program selects a small group of tribal members to spend the summer learning from tribal leaders and elders about our heritage, culture, and tribal government.
